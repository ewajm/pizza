#### By _Ewa Manek_

## Description

_A website for a pizza delivery place - JavaScript Object Practice_

###Specifications:

Program will create pizza objects with topping and size properties
* example input: large, mushrooms + pepperoni
* example output: {size: large, toppings: [mushrooms, pepperoni]}

Program will determine price of pizza based on topping and size properties
* example input: large, mushrooms + pepperoni
* example output: pizza.price = $15;

Program will be able to create multiple pizza objects based on user input
* example input: large, mushrooms + pepperoni; small, sausage
* example output: {size: large, toppings: [mushrooms, pepperoni]}, {size: small, toppings: [sausage]}

Program will create customer objects that will store ordered pizzas
* example input: large, mushrooms + pepperoni; small, sausage
* example output: customer1 = {pizzas = [{size: large, toppings: [mushrooms, pepperoni]}, {size: small, toppings: [sausage]}]}

Program will use customer objects at checkout to request delivery information
* example input: "123 Steve Ln"
* example output: customer.address = "123 Steve Ln"

Additional Feature Ideas (mostly UI probably):
* regional specialties based on input location
* silly locations (Portland, spacehttp://www.color-hex.com/color-palette/17107, Atlantis-generally under the sea http://www.color-hex.com/color-palette/13364, something fantasy relatedhttp://www.color-hex.com/color-palette/3694(seeliehttp://www.color-hex.com/color-palette/12975, unseelie?http://www.color-hex.com/color-palette/1753))
* pre-made pizza menu? (with ability to edit in case you don't like peppers)
* pizza for non-humans (aliens, robots, mermaids, vampires/the undead)
* drag and drop ingredients?
* delivery tracking! (random)
